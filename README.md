# Todo_App_With_RealmDB

## Lol, just playing around because I'm bored ğŸ™ƒ

- Refreshing usage of Realm, been a while. New updates look cool though (first time using the new @Persisted syntax ğŸŒš). Might start using Realm more often ğŸ˜Š
- Simplified form of MVVM with Repository Pattern. I think I might stick with this pattern ğŸ¥³
- Dependency Injection in practice ğŸ˜Œ
- Coordinators (incomplete coordinators ğŸ˜‚). Got bored again at this point, had to do something else ğŸ˜–

- Till when next I get bored again ğŸ¤§
